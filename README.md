# ChattyMcClient

**Description:**  
Lame attempt at an OpenAI API‚Äëcompatible client for Windows ‚Äì and possibly other .NET‚ÄØ8.0+ platforms.

You will be shocked to learn I'm not a developer, I'm an AI jockey.

This project was ~90% coded by awesomeness that is [Google‚Äôs Gemini‚ÄØ2.5‚ÄØPro](https://aistudio.google.com/suite/gemini-2-5-pro) (no affiliation) under my direction and constant nagging. All I wanted was a pony, and for LM Studio to release a client of their own. While we all wait for that, I built this to use it.  

**Fair warning**: This project is packed with inconsistencies and bugs throughout. Do not put it in charge of liver transplants or anything serious.

## Some features I found useful


| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Multi‚Äëchat sessions** | Written to a local JSON file you can edit and mess with. Great for debugging what your model is *actually* doing. |
| **Global or per‚Äësession settings** | ‚Ä¢ **Global mode:** one Settings, tool assignments, and system prompt applied to all chat/model sessions.<br>‚Ä¢ **Per‚ÄëSession mode:** each chat session gets its own settings. |
| **External tools support** | ‚Ä¢ Pick your language poison (Python, C++, C#, PowerShell (if you‚Äôre brave), Esperanto, whatever). There‚Äôs a protocol for input/output at the end.<br>‚Ä¢ Both you and your model can run tools.<br>‚Ä¢ Model uses this pattern: if it‚Äôs stubborn about tool use, put it in the System Prompt. <br>‚Ä¢ Input example: `@/<tool> <arguments>` (e.g., `@/search "how can I delete a certain chat app I accidentally downloaded?"`). |
| **Run / Edit / Delete / Copy / Exclude actions** | ‚Ä¢ **Run:** re‚Äëruns that user turn, overwriting/deleting the context from that point on.<br>‚Ä¢ **Edit:** edit your turn; when you save it, it will run‚ÄØ+ delete the context after that point.<br>‚Ä¢ **Delete:** use with caution ‚Äì deleting any but the last chat turn can break sequence.<br>‚Ä¢ **Copy:** copies the entry, markdown and all.<br>‚Ä¢ **Exclude:** ‚Äúexcludes‚Äù the content from the context sent to the model without removing it from the messages window. Useful for reducing chatter and raw content created by tools. <br>  Example flow: 1) Ask your model to use the ‚Äúwebscrape‚Äù tool on a website and create a summary.<br>  2) The tool imports raw HTML; your model creates a summary.<br>  3) You might not need that incomprehensible blob of HTML anymore. <br>There‚Äôs an option in settings to exclude tool output automatically. Why would you *not* want to use this always? Your model might get the summary wrong and you ask it again to look closer. |
| **Attach files to talk to** | WIP (like the rest of the app isn‚Äôt, lol), but also limited by what the server and model support.<br>‚Ä¢ Text files and images work; PDF does not (yet). |

Run tools from the unser prompt window using "@/" perfix to your tool name; eg: @/search "hello world!"

*Project size:* ~3.20‚ÄØMb, assuming you already have .NET‚ÄØ8.0 runtime installed. I have included a couple of ‚Äútools‚Äù for testing out of the box.

## Privacy, and data collection

Ha! Why would I want *any* of your data? That is yours to keep.  
I don‚Äôt get to know who you are, thank you very much, collect anything from you, have the app secretly send me your files, etc. **NONE.** I instantly hate any app that even asks for ‚Äúregistration‚Äù so I wouldn‚Äôt do that in my own.

This is a one‚Äëway street: you download this app, copy it, delete it, chop it to pieces, whatever. I don‚Äôt care.

If you *want* to reach me to tell me how I should **really** pick a different profession as I suck at this one, file a GitHub issue ‚Äì I‚Äôll see if I can fix that.

So GDPR hawks and people with nothing better to do: üòõ Nothing to see here.

## Source code

> Q: Why haven‚Äôt you released the source code?!? How do I know any of this is true!?  
> A. Yeah, you‚Äôre right. I wouldn‚Äôt trust a GitHub app I can‚Äôt scrutinize under the hood. I plan to release the sources but first need to clean it up, remove incriminating evidence, and ask a helpful AI to comment/document it so it‚Äôs useful.  

> Again: **I** would not download this app if I can‚Äôt see the sources. If you do, take full precautions. Run it in a VM‚Äëlike setup, full gas mask on, isolated, scan it for viruses, and generally keep it constrained until you‚Äôre comfortable with it, and/or I‚Äôve found the time to pretty up the sources and release them.

## Installation

1. **LOL, none.** Drop files onto a folder you like, and create a ‚ÄúTools‚Äù folder under it to hold your tools (if you want).

---

## A well thought out and organized list of FAQ

> Q: Why would you release this abomination onto an unsuspecting world?  
> A: I needed to appear busy. If I don‚Äôt look busy, my wife sends me to the mall. I‚Äôll do anything to escape the ravages of a mall. So, sorry. 

> And really, I looked for an OpenAI API‚Äëcompatible chat app for Windows and most of what I found were giant ‚Äúcontainers‚Äù or ones with several gigabytes‚Äëworth of requirements.

## Tools protocol

### Part 1: Tool Input ‚Äì How Chatty McClient passes tool argument

* The app passes a single string of command‚Äëline arguments.

* When you type a command like `@/search "The most capable model you can run on a single GPU"` in the chat, the application does the following:
  1. It identifies the tool by the alias (`/search`).
  2. It takes everything that comes *after* the alias and treats it as a single string of arguments.
  3. It launches the tool‚Äôs process and passes that string as an argument.

**How Your Script Receives It:**

| Language | How to access |
|----------|---------------|
| PowerShell (`.ps1`) | `$args` array; scripts use `param([string]$searchTerm)` which automatically assigns the first argument to `$searchTerm`. |
| Batch File (`.bat`) | `%1`, `%2`, ‚Ä¶ or `%*` for all of them. |
| Python (`.py`) | `sys.argv` list (e.g., `sys.argv[1]`). |

---

### Part 2: Tool Output ‚Äì How Chatty McClient receives payload from the tool

Your tool must still **print a single, valid JSON string** to Standard Output.

#### On Success
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "content": "All of your scraped text, including newlines, goes directly in this string."
}
```
* `"status": "success"` is mandatory.  
* `"content"`: a single string containing the complete text output of your tool.

#### On Failure
```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "error_message": "A clear description of what went wrong."
}
```

### Tool Example: Scrape Reddit sub for new posts

> NOTE: none of my business but please use with care. Reddit servers run on two tired hamsters and really don‚Äôt need the extra load of AI scraping their website on a loop.

```powershell
#Requires -Version 5.1

<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Scrapes post titles and links from an old.reddit.com page.

.DESCRIPTION
    A dedicated tool for old.reddit.com. It uses a simple, fast web request
    and regular expressions to parse the raw HTML. It extracts the
    title and URL for each post and formats them as a numbered Markdown
    link list for the Chatty McClient application.

.PARAMETER URL
    The full old.reddit.com URL to scrape (e.g., "https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLlama/new/").

.EXAMPLE
    .\reddit.ps1 -URL "https://old.reddit.com/r/PowerShell/"
#>

param(
    [Parameter(Mandatory=$true)]
    [string]$URL
)

# --- Main Execution ---
try {
    # Ensure the URL is a valid old.reddit.com URL
    if ($URL -notlike "https://old.reddit.com/*") {
        throw "This script is designed for old.reddit.com URLs only."
    }

    # Use simple web request method.
    $response = Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $URL -UseBasicParsing -ErrorAction Stop

    # Regex to find all post containers directly from the raw HTML content.
    # This specifically looks for the div that contains the title link.
    $postMatches = [regex]::Matches($response.Content, '(?si)<div class="entry unvoted.*?">.*?<a class="title.*?href="(.*?)".*?>(.*?)</a>.*?</div>')

    $outputBuilder = [System.Text.StringBuilder]::new()
    $postCounter = 1

    # Loop through each post container to extract its details.
    foreach ($match in $postMatches) {
        if ($match.Success) {
            $relativeUrl = $match.Groups[1].Value
            $title = $match.Groups[2].Value

            # Clean up the title by decoding any HTML entities (e.g., &amp; -> &)
            $cleanedTitle = [System.Net.WebUtility]::HtmlDecode($title).Trim()

            # Create absolute URL from the relative path.
            if ($relativeUrl -notlike "http*") {
                $absoluteUrl = "https://old.reddit.com$relativeUrl"
            } else {
                $absoluteUrl = $relativeUrl
            }

            # Append the formatted line to our output string.
            $null = $outputBuilder.AppendLine("$postCounter. [$cleanedTitle]($absoluteUrl)")
            $postCounter++
        }
    }

    $finalText = $outputBuilder.ToString()

    if ([string]::IsNullOrWhiteSpace($finalText)) {
        $finalText = "Scraping completed, but no posts were found on the page."
    }

    # Format the final output as a JSON object for success.
    $output = @{
        status = "success"
        content = $finalText
    }
}
catch {
    # If a critical error occurs, format as an error JSON.
    $errorMessage = "A critical error occurred. $($_.Exception.Message)"
    $output = @{
        status        = "error"
        error_message = $errorMessage
    }
}

# Convert the final result object to a compact JSON string and print to stdout.
$output | ConvertTo-Json -Compress | Write-Output
```
