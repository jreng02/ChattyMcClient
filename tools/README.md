**These are optional tools you can use with Chatty McClient.**

Note that in some cases, where API or IDs are used, you need to add your own in the tool. 

Example: 
- The Reddit tools need your own Reddit account listed so you don't get blocked by their servers.<br>
- Find "RedditReadDemo (by /u/Your-Reddit-Username-Here)" lines in the tool and add your ```/u/username``` there instead"

Other tools like Google Search require API key and search ID. Edit the tool script for more information.

More tools may be coming... depending on how good my models are at writing them :smirk:
